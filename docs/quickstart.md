# Quick Start
This guide provides a quick introduction to using Agent Zero. We'll cover the essential installation steps and running your first Skill.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

Download and install Docker Desktop for your operating system:

- **Windows:** Download from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and run the installer with default settings
- **macOS:** Download for Apple Silicon or Intel, drag to Applications, and enable the Docker socket in Settings → Advanced
- **Linux:** Install Docker Desktop or docker-ce following the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

> [!TIP]
> For complete OS-specific installation instructions, see the [full Installation Guide](setup/installation.md#step-1-install-docker-desktop).

### Step 2: Pull the Agent Zero Image

Using Docker Desktop GUI, search for `agent0ai/agent-zero` and click Pull, or use the terminal:

```bash
docker pull agent0ai/agent-zero
```

### Step 3: Run the Container

**Using Docker Desktop:** Go to Images tab, click Run next to `agent0ai/agent-zero`, open Optional settings, map a host port to container port `80` (use `0` for automatic assignment), then click Run.

**Using Terminal:**

```bash
docker run -p 0:80 agent0ai/agent-zero
```

The container will start in a few seconds. Find the mapped port in Docker Desktop (shown as `<PORT>:80`).

### Step 4: Open the Web UI and Configure API Key

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<PORT>`. The Web UI will show a warning banner about missing API key.

Click **Add your API key** to open Settings and configure:

- **Default Provider:** OpenRouter (supports most models with a single API key)
- **Alternative Providers:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama/LM Studio (local models), and many others
- **Model Selection:** Choose your chat model (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` for OpenRouter)

> [!NOTE]
> Agent Zero supports any LLM provider, including local models via Ollama. For detailed provider configuration and local model setup, see the [Installation Guide](setup/installation.md#choosing-your-llms).
